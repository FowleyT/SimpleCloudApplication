CSU44000 Internet Applications
Assignment#2 – A Simple Cloud Application
Prof. Donal O’Mahony

The objective of this assignment is to write a very simple client (employing Vue.js) interacting with a
server (implemented in Node.js) which in turn interacts with a Cloud-based Database (using AWS
DynamoDB) and an Object stored in the Object-store (using AWS S3)

Raw data concerning movies is stored in JSON format in an object store that I have set up at :
  - Region: EU(Ireland)
  - Bucket-Name:csu44000assignment2
  - Object Key (FileName):moviedata.json

You should write a simple client in Vue.js which has 3 buttons:
  1. Create Database
  2. Query Database with two input boxes to allow a movie name and a year to be entered
  3. Destroy Database

Clicking each of these buttons will invoke API primitives on your Cloud-based server and deal with
the responses.

- ‘Create’ should cause your Node.js server to make a table in a DynamoDB database – fetch the raw
data from the S3 object and upload it to the newly created database. You can use a small sub-set of
the fields including [title, release-date, rank]

- ‘Query’ should cause your Node.js server to find all the movies in a given year, that begin-with the
entered text string – and display them on the web-page

- ‘Destroy’ should cause the database table to be deleted.

A lot of code that you need to get this application working can be found in the AWS documentation
– which shows a related example:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.ht
ml - feel free to copy code verbatim from this.
You can mostly ignore error handling – This exercise is mainly about the main architectural elements
of the solution. Think about what you might need to do to scale this for 100 million simultaneous
users.

Ideally, you will submit a .HTML file containing the client side and a single .JS file containing the
server code. Both of these files should be printed-to-PDF before submission. Take a screen-shot of
your working application screen in the browser – showing the Amazon Cloud URL and submit this to
show how the application looks.
The submission deadline is Thursday 7th November, at 10pm.
